# DELICIOUS-Sandwiches

Welcome I'll like to introduce my GRAND DELI Sandwich Application  where you can order your sandwich from home or anywhere in seconds!!

This Sandwich give the ability to order many sandwiches and give a variety of sizes and Toppings.

The GRAND DELI Sandwich application keeps track of different orders and allows the customer to see their total cost before confirming their order to avoid any confusion or mistakes. It also provides the customer with a digital receipt, either on their mobile device or at the restaurant by the cashier.

##  Thinking Process

In my thinking process I had an outline of the different classes I want. With only one abstract class called ordersize and a interface of cashier that has the price to implement in all the classes : Topping, Sanwich, Drink, Chips. I only had one topping class where the Sandwitch has a topping arrayList. However I notice that I was missing somethings and created a second outline.

In my new Diagram I implement more class a Regular and Cost Topping that can extends from the topping abstract class. However the part that I was having trouble, once I had everything I was having toruble getting all the prices from the different class in one arrayList. I was able to find a solution by switching the price and size. Price to the sizeOrder and size to the product price.
